    * A very brief history:
        * Launched in July 2010, Cocos2d-x is the best open-source game engine available.
        * Versioning information (i.e C++, JS, Lua, not related to Cocos2d-iphone, etc)
         * Cocos2d-x comes in a variety of flavors:
             * c++ [c++](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/products#cocos2dx)
		     * Lua [Lua](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/products#cocos2dx-lua)
    *  Prerequisites:

2. Basic Concepts and Essentials

3. Sprites
    * What are Sprites?
    * Creating Sprites:
        * Creating a Textured Sprite.
        * Creating an Untextured Sprite.
        * Creating a Sprite From a SpriteFrame.
        * Creating a Sprite From SpriteCache.
        * Creating a Sprite From a Rect.
    * Sprite Manipulation:
        * Resizing.
        * Anchor Point and Position.
    * SpriteSheets.

4. Actions
    * What are Basic Actions:
        * Animate.
        * Fade In/Out.
        * Move.
        * Rotate.
        * Scale.
        * Tint.
        * Easing.
    * What are Sequences:
        * Spawn.
        * Reverse.
    * Running Actions and Sequences.

5. Building and Transitioning Scenes
    * What is a Scene?
    * Creating a Scene:
        * Creating a Node Tree.
        * Node properties to its descendants.
    * Coordinate Systems:
        * Converting between coordinate systems.
    * Transitioning between Scenes.

6. UI
    * Labels:
         * BMFont.
         * TTF.
         * Label Atlas.
         * SystemFont.
    * Label examples.
    * Menu/Menu Items:
        * What makes up a menu?
        * Menu Items and adding to a Menu.
        * Examples:
             * Create Menu with 1 item.
             * Create Menu from array of items.
             * Lambdas.
    * Buttons.
    * Scroll.
    * Layout.

7. Other Node Types
    * TMX.
    * Particle.
    * Parallax.

8. Event Dispatcher
    * What is the EventDispatch mechanism?
        * Responds to user events.
        * The basics:
            * Event listeners encapsulate your event processing code.
            * Event dispatcher notifies listeners of user events.
            * Event objects contain information about the events.
     * 5 types of event listeners:
         * `EventListenerTouch` - responds to touch events
             * describe what to override.
         * `EventListenerKeyboard` - responds to keyboard events
             * describe what to override.
         * `EventListenerAcceleration` - responds to accelerometer events
             * describe what to override.
         * `EventListenMouse` - responds to mouse events
             * describe what to override.
         * `EventListenerCustom` - responds to custom events
             * describe what to override.
     * Registering event with the dispatcher.
     * Removing events from the dispatcher.

9. 3D
    * 3D Sprite.
    * 3D Actions.
    * 3D Animations.
    * Placeholders for: Lights, Shadows, Cameras.

10. Lua

    * bindings to c++.
    * subclassing.
    * Placeholders for: memory management, Debug a Lua Game.

11. Services
    * Other SDK's.
    * Plugin-X.
    * Placeholders - IAP, FB.

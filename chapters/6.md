# Chapter 6: UI
Taking a look at the common apps you might use, I bet that you can spot UI
widgets without necessarily knowing what they are. They aren't specific to games,
every application probably uses a few widgets. What does _UI_ stand for? What do
_UI_ widgets do? Oh so many questions!

## Widgets, oh, my!
_UI_ is an abbreviation that stands for _user interface_. You know, things that
are on the screen. This include items like: _labels_, _buttons_, _menus_, _sliders_
and _views_. Cocos2d-x provides a set of _ui_ widgets to make it simple to add
these controls to your projects. It may sound trivial, but a lot goes in to
creating a core class like a _label_. There are so many aspects of just this one.
Could you imagine having to write your own custom widget set? Don't worry, your
needs are covered!

## Label
Cocos2d-x provides a `Label` object that can create labels using _true type_,
_bitmap_ or the built in system font. This single class can handle all your label
needs.

#### Label BMFont
`BMFont` is a label type that uses a bitmap font. The characters in a bitmap font are made
up of a matrix of _dots_. It is very fast and easy to use, but not scalable as
it requires a separate font for each size character. Each character in a `Label`
is a `Sprite`. This means that each character can be rotated, scaled, tinted,
have a different _anchor point_ and/or most any other property changed.

Creating a `BMFont` label requires two files: a _.fnt_ file and an image
representation of each character in _.png_ format. If you are using a tool like
*_Glyph Designer_* these files are created automatically for you. Creating a
`Label` object from a _bitmap font_:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithBMFont("bitmapRed.fnt", "Your Text");
```

![](6-img/LabelBMFont.png "")

All of the characters in the string parameter should be found in the provided
_.fnt_ file, otherwise they won't be rendered. If you render a `Label` object and
it is missing characters, make sure they exist in your _.fnt_ file.

#### Label TTF
_True Type Fonts_ are different from the _bitmap fonts_ we learned about above.
With _true type fonts_ the outline of the font is rendered. This is convenient
as you do not need to have a separate font file for each size and color you might
wish to use. Creating a `Label` object that uses a _true type font_ is easy. To
create one you need to specify a `.ttf` font file name, text string and a size.
Unlike `BMFont`, `TTF` can render size changes without the need for a separate
font files. Creating a `Label` object from a _true type font_:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF("Your Text", "Marker Felt.ttf", 24);
```
![](6-img/LabelTTF.png "")

Although it is more flexible than a _bitmap font_, a _true type font_ is slower
to render and changing properties like the _font face_ and _size_ is an expensive
operation.

If you need several `Label` objects from a _true type font_ that all have the same
properties you can create a `TTFConfig` object to manage them. A `TTFConfig`
object allows you to set the properties that all of your labels would have in common.
You can think of this like a *recipe* where all your `Label` objects will use
the same ingredients.

You can create a `TTFConfig` object for your `Labels` in this way:
```cpp
// create a TTFConfig files for labels to share
TTFConfig labelConfig;
labelConfig.fontFilePath = "myFont.ttf";
labelConfig.fontSize = 16;
labelConfig.glyphs = GlyphCollection::DYNAMIC;
labelConfig.outlineSize = 0;
labelConfig.customGlyphs = nullptr;
labelConfig.distanceFieldEnabled = false;

// create a TTF Label from the TTFConfig file.
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF(labelConfig, "My Label Text");
```

![](6-img/LabelTTFWithConfig.png "")

A `TTFConfig` can also be used for displaying Chinese, Japanese and Korean
characters.

#### Label SystemFont
`SystemFont` is a label type that uses the default system font and font size.
This is a font that is meant not to have its properties changed. You should think
of it as "system font, system rules". Creating a `SystemFont` label:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithSystemFont("My Label Text", "Arial", 16);
```

![](6-img/LabelWithSystemFont.png "")

## Label Effects
After you have your `Label` objects on screen you might want to make them a bit
prettier. Perhaps they look flat or plain. Thankfully you don't have to create
your own custom fonts! `Label` objects can have effects applied to them. Not all
_label_ types support all effects. Some effects include _shadow_, _outline_ and
_glow_. You can apply one or more effects to a `label` object easily:

Label with a __shadow__ effect:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF("myFont.ttf", "My Label Text", 16);

// shadow effect is supported by all Label types
myLabel->enableShadow();
```

![](6-img/LabelWithShadow.png "")

Label with a __outline__ effect:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF("myFont.ttf", "My Label Text", 16);

// outline effect is TTF only, specify the outline color desired
myLabel->enableOutline(Color4B::WHITE, 1));
```

![](6-img/LabelWithOutline.png "")

Label with a __glow__ effect:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF("myFont.ttf", "My Label Text", 16);

// glow effect is TTF only, specify the glow color desired.
myLabel->enableGlow(Color4B::YELLOW);
```

![](6-img/LabelWithGlow.png "")

## Menu and Menu Items
We are all probably familiar with what a menu is. We see these in every application
we use. In your game you would probably use a `Menu` object to navigate through
game options. Menus often contain *buttons* like _Play_, _Quit_, _Settings_ and
_About_. A `Menu` object is a special type of `Node` object. You can create an
empty `Menu` object as a place holder for your _menu items_:
```cpp
auto myMenu = Menu::create();
```
As we described options above of _Play_, _Quit_, _Settings_ and
_About_, these are your _menu items_ A `Menu` without _menu items_ makes little
sense.  Cocos2d-x offers a variety of ways to create your _menu items_ including
by using a `Label` object or specifying an image to display. _Menu items_ usually
have two possible states, a `normal` and a `selected` state. When you tap or click
on the _menu item_ a *callback* is triggered. You can think of this as a chain
reaction. You tap/click the _menu item_ and it runs the code you specified. A
`Menu` can have just a single item or many items.
```cpp
// creating a menu with a single item

// create a menu item by specifying images
auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
CC_CALLBACK_1(HelloWorld::menuCloseCallback, this));

auto menu = Menu::create(closeItem, NULL);
this->addChild(menu, 1);
```

A menu can also be created by using a `Vector` of `MenuItem` objects:

```cpp
// creating a Menu from a Vector of items
Vector<MenuItem*> MenuItems;

auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
CC_CALLBACK_1(HelloWorld::menuCloseCallback, this));

MenuItems.pushBack(closeItem);

/* repeat for as many menu items as needed */

auto menu = Menu::createWithArray(MenuItems);
this->addChild(menu, 1);
```

If you run the sample code for this chapter you will see a `Menu` containing
`Label` objects for `MenuItems`:

![](6-img/menu.png "")

### Lambda functions as Menu callbacks
Above we just learned that when you click a _menu item it triggers a _callback_.
C++11 offers _lambda_ functions and therefore Cocos2d-x takes full advantage of
them! A _lambda_ function is a function you write inline in your source code.
_Lambdas_ are also evaluated at runtime instead of compile time.

A simple _lambda_:
```cpp
// create a simple Hello World lambda
auto func = [] () { cout << "Hello World"; };

// now call it someplace in code
func();
```
Using a _lambda_ as a `MenuItem` callback:
```cpp
auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
[&](Ref* sender){
	// your code here
});
```
## Buttons
I doubt that we need to explain buttons much. We all know them as those things
we click on to make something happen in our games. Perhaps you might use a button
to change _scenes_ or to add `Sprite` objects into your game play.
A button intercepts a touch event and calls a predefined callback when tapped.
A `Button` has a _normal_ and _selected_ state. The appearance of the `Button` can
change based upon it's state. Creating a `Button` and defining it's _callback_ is simple:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto button = Button::create("normal_image.png", "selected_image.png", "disabled_image.png");

button->setTitleText("Button Text");

button->addTouchEventListener([&](Ref* sender, Widget::TouchEventType type){
		switch (type)
		{
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::BEGAN:
						break;
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::ENDED:
						std::cout << "Button 1 clicked" << std::endl;
						break;
				default:
						break;
		}
});

this->addChild(button);
```

As you can see in the above example we specify a _png_ image for each of the
possible states the button can be in. A `Button` is made up of 3 graphics that might look like this:

![](6-img/Button_Normal.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](6-img/Button_Press.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/Button_Disable.png "")

On screen a `Button` might look like this:

![](6-img/Button_example.png "")

## CheckBox
We are all used to filling out _checkboxes_ on paper forms like job applications
and rental agreements. You can also have _checkboxes_ in your games. Perhaps you
want to have the ability for your player to make a simple _yes_ or _no_ choice.
You might also hear this referred to as a _binary_ choice (0 and 1). A `CheckBox`
permits the user to make this type of choice. A `Checkbox` can have a
state of _normal_, _selected_ and _disabled_. Creating a `CheckBox` is simple:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto checkbox = CheckBox::create("check_box_normal.png",
                                 "check_box_normal_press.png",
                                 "check_box_active.png",
                                 "check_box_normal_disable.png",
                                 "check_box_active_disable.png");

checkbox->addTouchEventListener([&](Ref* sender, Widget::TouchEventType type){
		switch (type)
		{
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::BEGAN:
						break;
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::ENDED:
						std::cout << "checkbox 1 clicked" << std::endl;
						break;
				default:
						break;
		}
});

this->addChild(checkbox);
```
As you can see in the above example we specify a _png_ image for each of the
possible states the checkbox can be in. A `CheckBox` is made up of 5 graphics that might look like this:

![](6-img/CheckBox_Normal.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](6-img/CheckBox_Press.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/CheckBox_Disable.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/CheckBoxNode_Normal.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/CheckBoxNode_Disable.png "")

On screen a `Checkbox` might look like this:

![](6-img/Checkbox_example.png "")

## LoadingBar
Have you ever played a game where you had to wait while it loaded up all the
content it needed? It probably showed you a bar, filling in as it made progress
accomplishing its task. This is often referred to as a _progress bar_, _status bar_
or a _loading bar_. Creating a `LoadingBar`:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto loadingBar = LoadingBar::create("LoadingBarFile.png");

// set the direction of the loading bars progress
loadingBar->setDirection(LoadingBar::Direction::RIGHT);

this->addChild(loadingBar);
```
In the above example a _loading bar_ is created and we set the direction it
should fill towards as progress is made. In this case to the right direction.
However, you probably need to change the percentage of the `LoadingBar`. This is
easily done:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto loadingBar = LoadingBar::create("LoadingBarFile.png");
loadingBar->setDirection(LoadingBar::Direction::RIGHT);

// something happened, change the percentage of the loading bar
loadingBar->setPercent(25);

// more things happened, change the percentage again.
loadingBar->setPercent(35);

this->addChild(loadingBar);
```
As you can see in the above example we specify a _png_ image for the `LoadingBar`
objects texture:

![](6-img/LoadingBarFile.png "")

On screen a `LoadingBar` might look like this:

![](6-img/LoadingBar_example.png "")

## Slider
Sometimes it is necessary to change a value slightly. Perhaps you have a character
and you want to allow the player to adjust the strength of attacking an enemy.
A `Slider` allows user to set value by moving a indicator. To create a `Slider`:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto slider = Slider::create();
slider->loadBarTexture("Slider_Back.png"); // what the slider looks like
slider->loadSlidBallTextures("SliderNode_Normal.png", "SliderNode_Press.png", "SliderNode_Disable.png");
slider->loadProgressBarTexture("Slider_PressBar.png");

slider->addTouchEventListener([&](Ref* sender, Widget::TouchEventType type){
		switch (type)
		{
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::BEGAN:
						break;
				case ui::Widget::TouchEventType::ENDED:
						std::cout << "slider moved" << std::endl;
						break;
				default:
						break;
		}
});

this->addChild(slider);
```
As you can see in the above example we specify a _png_ image for each of the
possible states the slider can be in. A `Slider` is made up of 5 graphics that
might look like this:

![](6-img/Slider_Back.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](6-img/Slider_PressBar.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/SliderNode_Normal.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](6-img/SliderNode_Press.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "")
![](6-img/SliderNode_Disable.png "")

On screen a `Slider` might look like this:

![](6-img/Slider_example.png "")

## TextField
What if you wanted the player of your game to type in a special name to call the
main character? Where would they type it into? Yes, a _text field_, of course.
A `TextField` widget is used for inputting text. It supports touch event, focus,
percent positioning and percent content size. To create a `TextField` widget:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto textField = TextField::create("","Arial",30);

textField->addTouchEventListener([&](Ref* sender, Widget::TouchEventType type){
				std::cout << "editing a TextField" << std::endl;
});

this->addChild(textField);
```
In this example a `TextField` is created and a _callback_ specified.

`TextField` objects are versatile and can meet all of your input needs. Would you
like the user to enter a secret password? Do you need to limit the number of
characters a user can input? `TextField` objects have this all built it and much
more! Let's take a look at an example:
```cpp
#include "ui/CocosGUI.h"

auto textField = TextField::create("","Arial",30);

// make this TextField password enabled
textField->setPasswordEnabled(true);

// set the maximum number of characters the user can enter for this TextField
textField->setMaxLength(10);

textField->addTouchEventListener([&](Ref* sender, Widget::TouchEventType type){
				std::cout << "editing a TextField" << std::endl;
});

this->addChild(textField);
```
On screen a `TextField` might look like this:

![](6-img/TextField_example.png "")

When you are editing a `TextField`, the onscreen keyboard comes up:

![](6-img/TextField_example_keyboard.png "")




<!--
#### ImageView
A `ImageView` is a placeholder for displaying images. It supports touch events,
focus, percent positioning and percent content size. To create an `ImageView`:
```cpp
auto imageView = ImageView::create("ccicon.png");
imageView->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(imageView);
```
It is also possible to create an `ImageView` from a `SpriteFrame`:
```cpp
auto imageView = ImageView::create("ccicon.png", TextureResType::PLIST);
imageView->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(imageView);
```
## Text
A `Text` widget is used for displaying text. It can also use it as a _text-only_
button. You can think of a `Text` widget as `Text` supports system font and TTF fonts. To create a `Text` widget:
```cpp
auto text = Text::create("Text","fonts/MyTTF.ttf",30);

this->addChild(text);
```
You can add effects like _shadow_, _glow_ and _outline_ just like any `Label`
object.

### TextBMFont
A `TextBMFont` widget is used for displaying `BMFont` text. It supports touch
event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size. Creating a `TextBMFont`
is list like the `Text` widget:
```cpp
auto textBMFont = TextBMFont::create("BMFont", "bitmapFontTest2.fnt");
textBMFont->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(textBMFont);
```

#### TextAtlas
A `TextAtlas` widget is used for displaying text as an _atlas font_. It  supports
touch event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size.\
```cpp
auto textAtlas = TextAtlas::create("1234567890", "labelatlas.png", 17, 22, "0");
textAtlas->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(textAtlas);
```

#### RichText
A `RichText` widget is used for displaying text, image and custom nodes.  It
supports touch event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size. When
receiving a touch event the whole `RichText` widget receives the event. To create
a `RichText` widget:
```cpp
auto richText = RichText::create();
richText->ignoreContentAdaptWithSize(false);
richText->setContentSize(Size(100, 100));

auto re1 = RichElementText::create(1, Color3B::WHITE, 255, str1, "Marker Felt", 10);

richText->pushBackElement(re1);
richText->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
richText->setLocalZOrder(10);
this->addChild(_richText);
```
